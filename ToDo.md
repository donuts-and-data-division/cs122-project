#To Do

# Big things (backend)
## Main map
finish matching all locations to google place IDs
finish matching farmers market double value indicators to locations
Question: What to do with imperfect matches (no results, more than one result)?

set up geoquery capabilities -- how to enter info into form, get geocoded location and then query database to get view.
Question: Suggestions on best way to do this?

write script to map retailers to google place_id, longitude and latitude, price level, type
write code to call google place API with place_id when querying (i.e. get hours information).
design map / geoquety integration
desgin filters


## Grocery list
categorize retail location and map to food list
design multipier algorithm (e.g. location/region, store type, google $$ etc)

create updatable form => way for user to save grocery list.


## Nice additions
write script that automates price updating
write script that checks for changes in SNAP list.
