#To Do

# Big things
## Main map
Min Ratings -> radio buttons
Combine $$$, $$$$ and $$$$$? In the data I have there are 4 $$$$ and none with $$$$$.
There are currently duplicate places (i.e. 2 Hyde Park Produce results) (maybe updating database will fix this)
Clear search bar on back button (otherwise if the user presses filter the map won't recenter.)

Nice to have:
Hidable filters?

## Grocery list
determine foods available for each types
design multipier algorithm (e.g. location/region, store type, google $$ etc)
test database updating algorithms on map.

Add some instruction? (Perhaps instead of the cute snapmap, we can write "Make grocery list" 
(On my machine (ari) this isn't working ...)

Nice to have:
adjust serving size (lb vs loaf)


## Nice additions
write script that automates price updating
write script that checks for changes in SNAP list.
create updatable form => way for user to save grocery list.

### Small things
Organize repository
~~Emma stops being Anne~~

## Notes from check-in 2/8/17
Grocery list: 
Field research about multipliers for store types
Try it at one store and then do it at another store with our calculator

Add crowdsourcing.
