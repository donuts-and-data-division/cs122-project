#To Do
# Big things
## Main map

Tuesday:
DEDUP
There are currently duplicate places (i.e. 2 Hyde Park Produce results) (maybe updating database will fix this)

Add about page
Add way to send us angry emails.

Hours string formatting in info window

Make URLs urls in info window

ARI: zoom not researching anymore!

Change urls so map shows up without "auto" in the url.

Make scripts __name__ == "__main__": functions.?

Nice to have:
Hidable filters?

## Grocery list
determine foods available for each types

Add some instruction? (Perhaps instead of the cute snapmap, we can write "Make grocery list" 

## Operational things
update repo / clean up code
VM on flash drive

## Nice additions
write script that automates price updating -- write code that manipulates result from pull_user_data.py to match regression reqs
write script that checks for changes in SNAP list.
create updatable form => way for user to save grocery list.
adjust serving sizes (lb vs loaf)

### Small things
Organize repository
